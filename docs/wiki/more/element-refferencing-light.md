# More about: Variables and Functions

In the Grid Editor, **variables and functions** help you store and use data.  
They always have a **name**, and they live in different places depending on how you create them.

---

## üî¢ Types of Variables

There are **3 kinds of variables** in Grid:

- **Local** ‚Äì for one Event only  
- **Self** ‚Äì for one Control Element  
- **Global** ‚Äì shared across the whole page

Each one is created differently and used with different naming styles.

---

### üü¢ Local Variables

- Exist only during a single Event (e.g. Setup, Timer)
- Disappear after the Event ends
- Uses the `local` prefix before the name when created, but can be referenced without it

**Example:**
```lua
local myvar = 5 --creating the local variable

myvar = myvar + 5 --referencing the local variable
```

**Tip:** Define them in the **Locals Block** of the Event where you use them.

---

### üü† Self Variables

- Stored inside the Control Element
- Stay in memory and can be reused anytime
- Use `self.` or `element[x].` to reference or create them

**Example:**
```lua
self.counter = 0
```

**Tip:** Define in the **Self Block** of the Control Element's Setup Event.

---

### üîµ Global Variables

- Shared across the whole page
- Just create and reference them without a prefix, but using a Capitalized name for them is good practice

**Example:**
```lua
Gvalue = 100
```

**Tip:** Create in the **Global Block** of the **System Setup Event** to keep things organized.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functions

Functions have two parts:
- A **prefix** (who runs it)
- A **suffix** (what it does)

### Prefixes

- `self:` ‚Üí runs on this Control Element  
- `element[x]:` ‚Üí runs on Control Element `x`  
- *(none)* ‚Üí global function

### Suffix

The name of the function, like `button_value()` or `midi_send()`

**Examples:**
```lua
self:element_index() --this is a self function, called on that element
element[3]:button_value() --this is also a self function, but referenced from a different element
module_rotation() --this is a global function
```

## ‚úÖ Quick Syntax Rules

| Type      | Prefix      | Symbol | Ending   |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Variable  | `self.`     | `.`    | No `()`  |
| Function  | `self:`     | `:`    | Yes `()` |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Special Cases

- **LED functions** use no prefix. They take the LED number inside `()`.
- **Lua functions** like `math.random()` are from a LUA library, you can find them on the official LUA documentation page.
- Other exceptions are noted in the [Reference Manual](/docs/reference-manual/introduction.md).
