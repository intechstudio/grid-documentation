#### What are Endless Rotary Potentiometers?

- Endless Rotary Potentiometers offer precise and continuous rotational control.
- Enable smooth and intuitive manipulation of parameters.
- They feature push-button functionality for additional actions or functions with a simple press.

#### Endless Rotary Potentiometers with anodized aluminium Knobs:

- Features anodized aluminium knobs that provide a tactile and ergonomic feel.
- Designed to offer a comfortable grip and effortless rotation.
- Allows for smooth and precise adjustments with just one finger.
- Ensures durability and reliability, built for rigorous usage and long-term performance.

### Differences between Encoders and Normal Potentiometers:

- Range of Motion: Encoders offer infinite rotation, while normal potentiometers have fixed endpoints. But with TEK2, the Potentiometers have endless rotation, much like an Encoder.
- Digital vs. Analog Output: Encoders provide digital signals, while normal potentiometers offer analog output.
- Precision and Resolution: our Encoders offer stepped rotation for precise adjustments, whereas potentiometers provide smooth and fine control.
