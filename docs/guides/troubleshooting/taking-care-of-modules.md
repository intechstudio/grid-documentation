Grid utilizes cool tech to let you achieve cool things. To ensure that you can use your modules for a long time, sometimes a bit of care can come a long way. For example, if the USB connection is unreliable or the connection between modules cuts out, start with cleaning the contacts (USB connector and gold pins on the side).

## Maintaining Your Grid Modules

The goal is to keep the connectors clean and free of any debris or residue that could prevent optimal connectivity. This maintenance includes cleaning both the USB-C connectors and the pogo-pin connectors on the side, as well as the magnets that help keep things in place.

You can achieve this using easily available cleaning solutions and tools. Here’s what you’ll need for proper care:

## :toolbox: Recommended Tools and Materials

For cleaning your Grid modules, simply gather the following items:

- Isopropyl Alcohol (90% or higher): Ideal for electronic components. Make sure it's pure isopropyl alcohol.
- Cotton Swabs or Cleaning Sticks: For precise application of cleaning solution to small areas.
- Non-abrasive microfiber cloth or lint-free cloth: Useful for gently wiping down surfaces.
- Small brush: To clean around delicate areas such as magnets.

(Tip)The electronic cleaner is suitable to remove manufacturing (soldering) residue from the connectors. Any electronic cleaning substance can be sufficient, for reference we strongly recommend the following: [electronic cleaner](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=isopropyl+electronics+cleaner&ref=nb_sb_noss_2).

## :grey_question: How To Maintain Your Grid

### 1. Cleaning USB-C Connectors

USB-C ports and cables are critical to ensuring your modules communicate well. Over time, dust and dirt can collect inside the connectors, leading to connectivity issues.

Follow these steps:

1. Turn off your module and unplug all connected devices.
2. Apply a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to a cotton swab or cleaning stick.
3. Use the swab to gently clean inside the USB-C port(s) on the module.
4. Plug and unplug your USB-C cable 10 times to help loosen up any debris inside the ports. Make sure the other end of the cable is NOT connected to any device.
5. After cleaning, allow the connector to dry for a few minutes before using the module again.

### 2. Cleaning the Side Pogo Pins and Connectors

Pogo pins are the metallic pins used for connecting modules to each other. Keeping these pins clean and free of grime ensures reliable connections.

Here's how to clean them:

1. Turn off your module and ensure that no cables or power sources are attached.
2. Dab isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab.
3. Gently rub each of the pogo pins with the swab to remove dirt or residue.
4. For the connectors, clean around the pins to ensure there’s no debris blocking proper contact.
5. Wait for a few minutes until the area is fully dry, then test the connection with your modules.

### 3. Cleaning the Magnets

Magnets are often easily overlooked, but they can also accumulate dust and debris, which may impair their ability to hold modules firmly together. Periodically cleaning them will help ensure a solid connection.

To clean the magnets:

1. Turn off and detach the module(s) from any connected system.
2. Take a small brush—a soft toothbrush or an antistatic brush works well—and gently brush away any dirt or particles accumulated on or around the magnets.
3. If the magnets are particularly dirty, dampen a microfiber cloth with a little isopropyl alcohol and gently wipe down the magnet surfaces.
4. Let it air dry for a few minutes before reattaching modules.

## :bulb: Some Additional Tips

- Avoid using water or household cleaners on your modules as these can cause damage to delicate components. Stick to isopropyl alcohol (>90%) for all cleaning purposes.
- Regular maintenance: Even if your modules seem to be working fine, it's a good idea to clean the contacts and magnets about once every few months to keep things in good condition.
- Storage: When not in use, store your modules in a dust-free environment, ideally in a case or box to prevent debris from collecting around the connectors.
