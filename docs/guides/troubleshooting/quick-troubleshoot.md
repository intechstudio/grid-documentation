# Troubleshooting Grid Connection and Performance Issues

Grid modules are designed for seamless connectivity and performance, but sometimes issues can arise. This article provides step-by-step guidance to help you identify and resolve common problems.

### Resolving Connection Issues with the Grid Editor

If your Grid module is not recognized by the Grid Editor, it could be due to connectivity issues. USB hubs, in particular, may not establish a proper connection. To address this:

- **Step 1**: Disconnect the Grid from the USB hub.
- **Step 2**: Plug the Grid directly into your computer.
  This ensures a stable and direct connection, allowing the Grid Editor to detect your module.

### Troubleshooting Software Recognition Problems

When your software fails to recognize the Grid module, the issue may lie in the USB connection or MIDI settings. Follow these steps:

- **Check the Connection**: Avoid USB hubs and connect the Grid directly to your computer.
- **Enable MIDI Settings**: Open the preferences or settings menu in your software and ensure the Grid module is enabled for MIDI communication.
  These steps will help your software identify and work with the Grid seamlessly.

### Resolving Connection Issues with the Grid Editor

Sometimes, Grid modules don’t connect properly when snapped together. This is often due to incorrect orientation or surface issues. To fix this:

- **Flat and solid surface:** Ensure you are using the Grid on a flat, solid surface and align the modules horizontally to ensure proper connection.
  Proper alignment and a stable surface will create a secure and functional connection.

### Fixing Firmware Update Failures

If your firmware update fails, follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Perform a factory reset on your Grid module.
- **Step 2**: Close all programs except the Grid Editor.
- **Step 3**: Ensure a direct and stable connection (no USB hub) between the Grid and your computer.
- **Step 4**: While in bootloader mode, check if the Grid appears as a disk in your file browser or Finder.

### Addressing Freezing or Skipped MIDI Messages

Grid modules may freeze or skip messages during use if there are too many MIDI clock or sync messages. To prevent this:

- **Step 1**: Open your software settings.
- **Step 2**: Disable MIDI clock/sync messages send.
  This reduces the processing load on the Grid module, ensuring smoother performance.
