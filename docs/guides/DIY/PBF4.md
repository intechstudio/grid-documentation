## **ðŸ’¡ GRID PBF4 MIDI Controller Assembly Guide**

Welcome to the family\! We're thrilled you've chosen our DIY MIDI controller kit. This guide will walk you through the simple assembly process. Just follow these steps, and you'll be making music in no time.

### **What's in the box?**

Before you begin, confirm you have all the necessary components:

* Controller housing  
* Main circuit board  
* Front panel  
* Screws:  
  * 4 x M1.6x8mm stainless steel screws (for spacers)  
  * 4 x M1.6x16mm stainless steel screws (for the front panel)  
* 4 x Brass spacers  
* 4 x Potentiometer knobs   
* 4 x Fader caps  
* 4 x MX keycaps  
* **You'll need a PH0 screwdriver (not included in the kit).**

### **Assembly Steps**

#### **Step 1: Prepare the Housing and Motherboard**

First, orient the **controller housing** so the USB-C port cutout is at the top. The utility button cutout should be at the bottom.

Now, take the **main circuit board**. Make sure it's oriented in the same directionâ€”the USB port should be at the top and the utility button at the bottom. The side of the board with the soldered components should be facing you.

#### **Step 2: Install the Motherboard**

With both parts aligned, gently insert the circuit board into the housing at a slight angle. The key is to slide the **USB port through its cutout first**.

Once the USB port is in place, gently apply pressure to the bottom of the housing. This will create just enough flex to allow the **utility button** to clear the housing's edge and the board to snap securely into place. You'll feel it "pop" in.

#### **Step 3: Secure the Motherboard**

Next, secure the motherboard using the **four brass spacers** and the **M1.6x8mm screws**. Place a spacer in each of the four silver pads of the board, and then use your PH0 screwdriver to screw the shorter M1.6x8mm screws into the spacers. This keeps the motherboard firmly in place.

#### **Step 4: Attach the Front Panel**

You have a choice for your front panel's appearance\! One side has a smooth, clear black finish, while the other has a waffle texture and "hello hacker" text. You can use either side. If you want to switch the panel's direction, simply **pop out the light pipes** from their holes and reinsert them from the other side.

To install the panel, align the holes with the potentiometer shafts. Carefully press the front panel down until it sits flush against the housing.

With the panel in place, use the **four longer M1.6x16mm screws** to secure it. The screws go directly into the four corners of the housing.

#### **Step 5: Add the Potentiometer Knobs, Fader Caps, and MX Keycaps**

Now it's time to add the final components to your controller\!

* **Potentiometer Knobs:** Take the **four potentiometer knobs**. Each knob has a flat side that needs to be aligned with the flat side of the potentiometer's shaft. Once aligned, press down firmly to secure it in place.  
* **Fader Caps:** For the fader caps, simply **firmly push** each of the four fader caps onto the metal shafts of the faders. They are designed to fit snugly.  
* **MX Keycaps:** When placing the four MX keycaps, you'll see a small "shine-through dot" on each. For the best lighting effect, align this dot with the light pipe on the mechanical switch. The dot should be at the top, or "north" side, of the switch stem.

Our PBF4 is compatible with any MX-style keycaps, so feel free to experiment with different combinations to customize your controller\!

### **Final Check**

You're done\! Your MIDI controller is now assembled. To confirm everything is working, connect the device to your computer using a USB-C cable. The lights on the board should illuminate, indicating that it's receiving power and is ready to go.

Enjoy creating\! ðŸŽ¶
