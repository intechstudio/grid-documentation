## **ðŸ’¡ GRID EN16 Assembly Guide**

Thank you for choosing the Intech Studio Grid DIY Kit. This guide will walk you through the simple assembly process. The process should take no more than a few minutes.

**What's in the box?**

Before you begin, confirm you have all the necessary components in the box of the DIY kit:

* 1x Housing assembly  
* 1x EN16 Motherboard PCB  
* 1x EN16 Front panel  
* 8x Screws  
  * 4x Silver screws (M1.6x8mm)  
  * 4x Black screws (M1.6x16mm)  
* 4x Brass spacers

### **Assembly Steps**

#### **Step 1: Prepare the Housing and Motherboard**

First, orient the **controller housing** so the USB-C port cutout is at the top. The utility button cutout should be at the bottom.

Now, take the **motherboard**. Make sure it's oriented in the same directionâ€”the USB port should be at the top and the utility button at the bottom. The side of the board with the soldered components should be facing you.

#### **Step 2: Install the Motherboard**

With both parts aligned, gently insert the circuit board into the housing at a slight angle. The key is to slide the **USB port through its cutout first**.

Once the USB port is in place, gently apply pressure to the bottom of the housing. This will create just enough flex to allow the **utility button** to clear the housing's edge and the board to snap securely into place. You'll feel it "pop" in.

#### **Step 3: Secure the Motherboard**

Next, secure the motherboard using the **four brass spacers** and the **silver** **M1.6x8mm screws**. Place a spacer in each of the four silver pads of the board, and then use your PH0 screwdriver to screw the shorter M1.6x8mm screws into the spacers. This keeps the motherboard firmly in place.

#### **Step 4: Attach the Front Panel**

*You have a choice for your front panel's appearance\! One side has a smooth, clear black finish, while the other has a waffle texture and "hello hacker" text. You can use either side.*  
*If you want to switch the panel's direction, simply **pop out the lightpipes** from their holes and reinsert them from the other side.*

To install the panel, align the holes with the encoder shafts. Carefully press the front panel down until it sits flush against the housing.

With the panel in place, use the **black M1.6x16mm screws** to secure it. The screws go directly into the four corners of the housing.

**Be careful not to overtighten the corner screws, as this could cause the front panel to bend outwards.** Best practice is to tighten the screws until you feel considerable resistance, then loosen it by a quarter turn.

#### **Step 5: Add the Encoder Knobs**

Finally, it's time to add the finishing touches\! Take your **encoder knobs**. Each knob and potentiometer shaft has a flat side. Align the flat side of the knob with the flat side of the shaft. This is crucial for the knobs to turn correctly.

Once aligned, press down firmly on the knob. It may require a little pressure to seat it fully. Repeat this for all 16 encoders.

#### **Final Step: Apply the Serial Number**

As the final step, take the **Serial number sticker** and find its place on the bottom of the assembled module. Apply the sticker matching the one above it in orientation.

This sticker will help us identify your Grid module, so make sure itâ€™s attached to the housing firmly.

### **Final Check**

To confirm everything is working, connect the device to your computer using a USB cable. The LED lights should all illuminate in blue after a successful boot.

You're done\! Your Grid controller is now assembled.
