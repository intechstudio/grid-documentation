In the Packages section, youâ€™ll find additional tools that extend the functionality of the Editor and Grid. These packages allow you to control external software and add advanced features to your setup.

### MIDI Monitor

Use the MIDI Monitor to visualize incoming and outgoing MIDI messages. It's useful for troubleshooting and verifying that your controls are sending the expected data.

### Debug Monitor

The Debug Monitor allows you to send **Immediate** commands directly to the system. This is useful for debugging or for performing tasks like centering and calibrating potentiometers.

### WebSocket Monitor

Monitor real-time WebSocket communication for integrations with external tools and scripts. Helpful for advanced setups and developers.

### Active Window

With this feature, you can change the current preset page based on which application window is in focus.  
For example, when Spotify is active, the controller can switch to the Spotify preset. If you switch to Lightroom, the controller automatically changes to the Lightroom preset.

### Current Packages in the Grid Editor

- Lightroom  
- Photoshop
